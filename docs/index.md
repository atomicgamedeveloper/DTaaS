# What is the DTaaS Platform?

The Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) software platform is designed
to <font color="orange"> **Build, Use and Share** </font> digital twins (DTs)[^1].

:mechanical_arm: <font color="orange">**Build**</font>: DTs are constructed on
DTaaS using reusable DT assets available on the platform.

:office_worker: :factory_worker: <font color="orange">**Use**</font>: DTs
can be executed on the DTaaS platform.

:handshake: <font color="orange">**Share**</font>: Ready-to-use DTs can be shared
with other users. It is also possible to share the services
offered by one DT with other users.

Here is an overview of the DTaaS platform available in the form of
