# Requirements

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip localhost

    These optional requirements are not needed for
    [**localhost**](./localhost.md) installation.
    They are only required for installation of the DTaaS on
    a production web server.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

Two optional requirements exist for installing the DTaaS.

## OAuth 2.0 Provider

The DTaaS platform uses OAuth 2.0 for user authorization. It is
possible to use either <http:>_gitlab.com_</http:> or a custom
OAuth 2.0 service provider.

## Domain name

The DTaaS platform is a web application and is preferably hosted
on a server with a domain name such as <http:>_foo.com_</http:>.
However, installation on a local computer with access at
<http:>_localhost_</http:> is also supported.
