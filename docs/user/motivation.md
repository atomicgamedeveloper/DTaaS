# DTaaS for Users

## User Guide

This guide is intended for users of the DTaaS platform.
Access to a live installation of the DTaaS platform is required.
The simplest option is the
[localhost](../admin/localhost.md) installation scenario.

The following user-specific
[Slides](https://odin.cps.digit.au.dk/into-cps/dtaas/assets/20250605-Users.pdf)
and

provide the conceptual framework behind composable digital twins in the DTaaS platform.

## Motivation

A central question in Digital Twin (DT) software platforms is how to enable
collaborative activities:

* Building digital twins (DTs)
* Utilizing DTs independently
* Sharing DTs with other users
* Providing existing DTs as a service to other users

Additionally, DT software platforms must address:

* Support for DT lifecycle management
* Scalability through flexible convention over configuration

## Existing Approaches

Several solutions have been proposed in recent literature to address
these challenges. Notable approaches include:

* Focus on data from Physical Twins (PTs) for
  analysis, diagnosis, and planning
* Sharing DT assets across upstream and downstream stakeholders
* Evaluating different models of PT
* DevOps methodologies for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS)
* Scaling DT execution and ensemble management of related DTs
* Support for PT product lifecycle

## Our Approach

The DTaaS platform adopts the following principles[1]:

* Support for transition from existing workflows to DT frameworks
* Creation of DTs from reusable assets
* Enabling users to share DT assets
* Offering DTs as a Service
* Integration of DTs with external software systems
* Separation of configurations for independent DT components
